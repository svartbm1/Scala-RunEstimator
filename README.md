# Scala-RunEstimator

This is the first verison of RunEstimator. I did this in Scala, which I'm familiar with, as a test so I could later redo it
in a way that it works in the game. (In WoW Lua.) It has a few functions the Lua version doesn't as of now.
This was simply a test version and doesn't have a UI but works in the console.

The premise is the same as for the functional addon. The user inputs 2 numbers, one "dropchance" and one "desired probability"
the program then runs a calculation of how many times the dropchance needs to be applied to reach the desired probability to 
recieve the wanted item.
